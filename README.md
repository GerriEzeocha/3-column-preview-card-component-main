## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass preprocessor
- Flexbox


### What I learned
I was having some trouble with my body layout and realized that
the order of which I was writing my global sizes in CSS contributed to this.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.wesbos.com) - I have been working through some of Wes's Courses and it has been very helpful in understanding an overall concept and ways to tailor my approach. His approach helped me figure out my sizing issues.
